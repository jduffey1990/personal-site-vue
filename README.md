## Introduction

I started my working life as a dentist. After 5 years of practicing dentistry, I decided that being in health care wasn't my true calling. I wanted my career to fit my skills better, and to curate my career around my life, not the other way around. I am now pursuing a career in software development in Denver, CO.

## Why Vue Over React?

For new developers, choosing between Vue and React might be a challenging decision. Here are a few reasons why a developer might opt for Vue:

1. **Easier Learning Curve**: Vue is often lauded for its straightforward syntax and clear separation of concerns, making it accessible for beginners.
2. **Detailed Documentation**: Vue's documentation is comprehensive and beginner-friendly, complete with explanations and examples.
3. **Reactive Data Binding**: Vue offers a simpler mechanism for reactivity compared to React's state and props.
4. **Flexibility**: Vue allows developers to structure their app however they want, whereas React prescribes certain patterns.
5. **Community and Ecosystem**: While React's community is undeniably larger, Vue's community is tight-knit and rapidly growing.

Experimenting with Vue can demonstrate adaptability and a willingness to learn and utilize the best tool for a specific job to potential employers.
