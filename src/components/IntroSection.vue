            <h2>Hello, and welcome to my site. My name is Jordan Duffey</h2>
            <p>I started my working life as a dentist. After 4 years in private practice, I decided that being in health
                care
                wasn't my true calling. I decided that I wanted my career to fit my skills better,
                and to curate my career around my life, not the other way around. I now am pursuing a career in software
                development in Denver, CO. Things that drew me to the job of being a software developer include:</p>
            <!--Below is a list of reasons I decided to pursue this path, in no specific order.-->
            <ul>
                <li>Freedom to work remotely or in the office depending on the specific job.</li>
                <li>Decent career pay with lots of flexibility.</li>
                <li>Being able to solve a new problem, or differing parts of a larger problem, every single day.</li>
                <li>I have always been talented at math and I have loved learning languages, so programming gives me the
                    chance
                    to demonstrate weilding algorithms and learning many digital languages.</li>
            </ul>
