            <h2>About Jordan</h2>
            <p>Jordan was born in Tucson, AZ and moved to Colorado Springs early in life. He attended college at UCLA
                and
                earned
                a B.S. in Psychobiology as a predental major. He returned home to attend the University of Colorado
                School
                of
                Dental medicine, where he gratuated summa cum laude with honors. After dental school, he did a General
                Practice
                Residency staying at CU to pursue extended learning in implant dentistry, endodontics, and other more in
                depth
                general dental procedures.</p>
            <p> After 4 years of practice in the Greater Denver Area, Jordan decided that he wasn't truly meant to
                pursue a
                life
                in health care. It was a difficult decision, but his stress levels and day to day enjoyment of life
                increased.
                After some introspection and a greater understanding of his strengths and interests, Jordan decided to
                become a
                programmer. He did some free education online and some paid courses through Udemy to solidify his
                interest
                in
                coding.</p>
            <p>I chose <a href="https://www.thinkful.com" class="btn">Thinkful</a>
                as
                <b>THE</b> bootcamp for me for many reasons. I think the top reasons for me are:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Thinkful offers mentorship and career services that have, even this early in the program, been a
                    huge
                    help!
                </li>
                <li>The modules are clearly presented and easily understood with text, modules, assignments, and videos.
                </li>
                <li>The price was right! No other top rated bootcamps I saw offer a discount for the self paced program,
                    and
                    still offered the same mentorship and career services.</li>
                <li>The self-paced program was right for me, as I have other things going on in life and can't give 60+
                    hours a
                    week to studies.</li>
            </ol>
